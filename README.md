# VIC-20 assembly programs

The VIC-20 was my first computer when I was a child, and I regret not having been able to program complex things with it beyond BASIC. So some 30-40 years later, as a personal pleasure and a tribute to that little computer, I wrote these games in assembly, fully exploiting the limited, but quite complete, VIC's hardware. And indeed it can do amazing things when going low-level!

## Sokoban

This is a huge game in a small space! A port of sokoban game, see my port of ksokoban. I managed to compress 153 levels from the "microban" level set. Available for 3k and 8k expansion (see d64 files in Releases). It features multi-color graphics, keyboard and joystick, undo moves, codes to unlock levels and (8k version only) background two-voice music (interrupt-driven).

Press "H" for a complete list of keys. If you want to cheat, the code for the last level is ADHHKK (unlocks all levels from 1 to 153).
